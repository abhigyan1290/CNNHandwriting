## Introduction
HandwritingCNN is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch in C++ for recognizing handwritten digits. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience that I did to reinforce the fundamentals of deep learning, neural network architectures, and the complexities of implementing such models in a high-performance language like C++. 

By building the CNN from the ground up, this project provides deep insights into:

- **Data Processing**: Handling and preprocessing image data for training and testing.
- **Neural Network Layers**: Implementing convolutional, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Training Mechanism**: Forward and backward propagation, loss computation, and weight optimization.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- **From-Scratch Implementation**: No high-level deep learning libraries used; all components are manually implemented to provide a clear understanding of their workings.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized codebase with separate modules for different neural network layers and utilities.
- **Efficient Computations**: Utilizes the Eigen library for optimized linear algebra operations.
- **Dataset Handling**: Includes tools for downloading, parsing, and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- **Training and Evaluation Scripts**: Easily train the model and evaluate its performance on test data.
- **Extensible Design**: Designed to allow easy addition of new layers, activation functions, or optimizers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++ (C++11 standard)
- **Build System**: CMake
- **Libraries**:
  - Eigen for linear algebra operations
  - OpenCV (Optional) for image processing
- **Dataset**: MNIST (Modified for this project)

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler**: Supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the repository
- **Eigen Library**: For linear algebra operations
- **OpenCV** (Optional): For advanced image processing tasks

### Installing Prerequisites
Instructions for setting up prerequisites are included in the README.

## Installation
