Introduction
HandwritingCNN is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch in C++ for recognizing handwritten digits. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience to understand the fundamentals of deep learning, neural network architectures, and the complexities of implementing such models in a high-performance language like C++.

By building the CNN from the ground up, this project provides deep insights into:

Data Processing: Handling and preprocessing image data for training and testing.
Neural Network Layers: Implementing convolutional, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers.
Training Mechanism: Forward and backward propagation, loss computation, and weight optimization.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and efficiency.
Features
From-Scratch Implementation: No high-level deep learning libraries used; all components are manually implemented to provide a clear understanding of their workings.
Modular Architecture: Organized codebase with separate modules for different neural network layers and utilities.
Efficient Computations: Utilizes the Eigen library for optimized linear algebra operations.
Dataset Handling: Includes tools for downloading, parsing, and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
Training and Evaluation Scripts: Easily train the model and evaluate its performance on test data.
Extensible Design: Designed to allow easy addition of new layers, activation functions, or optimizers.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++ (C++11 standard)
Build System: CMake
Libraries:
Eigen for linear algebra operations
OpenCV (Optional) for image processing
Dataset: MNIST (Modified for this project)
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

C++ Compiler: Supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
CMake: Version 3.10 or higher
Git: For version control and cloning the repository
Eigen Library: For linear algebra operations
OpenCV (Optional): For advanced image processing tasks
Installing Prerequisites
1. C++ Compiler
Windows: Install Visual Studio which includes MSVC.
macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
bash
Copy code
xcode-select --install
Linux: Install GCC or Clang via your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
2. CMake
Refer to the CMake Installation Guide for detailed instructions based on your operating system.

3. Eigen
Download Eigen from the official website and follow the installation instructions. Eigen is a header-only library, so typically, you just need to extract it and include its path in your project.

4. OpenCV (Optional)
If you choose to use OpenCV for image processing:

Windows: Use pre-built binaries or build from source.
macOS: Install via Homebrew:
bash
Copy code
brew install opencv
Linux: Install via your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the HandwritingCNN project on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone 
cd HandwritingCNN
2. Download the MNIST Dataset
The project includes scripts to download and preprocess the MNIST dataset. Alternatively, you can manually download it from Yann LeCun's website and place the files in the data/ directory.

3. Configure the Build with CMake
Create a build directory and configure the project using CMake.

bash
Copy code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
If CMake cannot find Eigen or OpenCV automatically, you may need to specify their paths:

bash
Copy code
cmake -DEigen3_DIR=/path/to/eigen -DOpenCV_DIR=/path/to/opencv ..
4. Build the Project
Compile the project using CMake.

bash
Copy code
cmake --build .
Alternatively, you can use Make:

bash
Copy code
make
Dataset
MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each sized at 28x28 pixels.

Dataset Structure
Training Images: train-images.idx3-ubyte
Training Labels: train-labels.idx1-ubyte
Testing Images: t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
Testing Labels: t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte
These files should be placed in the data/ directory of the project.

Data Preprocessing
The project includes utilities to:

Parse IDX Files: Convert binary IDX files into usable data structures.
Normalize Pixel Values: Scale pixel intensities to a range of [0, 1].
One-Hot Encode Labels: Transform integer labels into one-hot vectors for multi-class classification.
